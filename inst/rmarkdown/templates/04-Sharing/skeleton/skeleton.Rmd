These notes explain how to share Shiny web apps and interactive documents. The notes accompany RStudio's workshop, [Interactive Reporting with R Markdown and Shiny](http://shiny-dc.eventbrite.com). For more details on using Shiny see <http://shiny.rstudio.com>.

These notes build on the companion study guides, 

* _Study Guide 1 - R Markdown Reports_
* _Study Guide 2 - Interactive Docs_
* _Study Guide 3 - Shiny Web Apps_

which describe how to build R Markdown reports, interactive documents, and Shiny web apps.

# Sharing

Share a Shiny app by

1. Sharing files for users to run locally with R
2. Hosting the app online
    + Users do not need to own or understand R to use a hosted Shiny app
3. Embedding the app in R
    + Package the app as an R function
    
# Share as files

Anyone with a copy of your app directory can run the app on their computer in the same way that you run the app on your own computer.

Shiny contains four functions that make it easy to share files for users to run locally. A user can call

* `runApp()` - to run apps whose files that have been downloaded to their computer
* `runGist()` - to run apps whose files have been posted at <http://gist.github.com>
* `runGitHub()` - to run apps whose files have been posted at <http://github.com>
* `runUrl()` - to run apps whose files have been posted at a web URL

# Host online

The most convenient way to share a Shiny app is to host it at its own URL. 

* users can easily visit the app
* users do not need to have R installed on their computer to run the app
* users do not need to understand R to use the app

You can host an app on the internet or on any intranet run by a server.

To host an app, either

1. Upload the app to <http://shinyapps.io>, a free hosting service run by RStudio.
2. Build a server to host the app with [Shiny Server](http://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) or [Shiny Server Pro](http://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny-server-pro/)

## shinyapps.io

Shinyapps.io is a free app hosting service with paid tiers maintained by RStudio. Shinyapps.io is

* **easy to use** - deploy apps with one click with the `shinyapps` package
* **secure** - password protect your apps with SSL encryption
* **scalable** - app resources scale as users increase. Apps that require large amounts of resources can be supported on a paid plan.

### Set up

To use shinyapps.io,

1. Install
    + (for Windows users only) [RTools]() for building packages
    + (for Mac users only) [XCode Command Line Tools]() for building packages
    + (for Linux users only) [GCC]() for building packages
2. Install the `devtools` package from cran 

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

3. Install the `shinyapps` package from github
```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/shinyapps")
```
4. Load the `shinyapps` package
```{r eval = FALSE}
library("shinyapps")
```
5. Create an account at <http://shinyapps.io>
   + Sign in with a Google or Github account, or create a new shinyapps.io account

6. Retrieve your token from the shinyapps.io dashboard by clicking _<Your username> (Upper right hand corner) > Token > Show > Copy to clipboard
![](shinyapps-token.png)

7. Paste the copied command into the RStudio command line and click enter
```{r eval = FALSE}
shinyapps::setAccountInfo(name='something', token='something', secret='something')
```

These steps link your RStudio IDE to your shinyapps.io account. They also prepare your computer to build apps (and their package dependencies) to deploy online.

### deploy

To deploy an app to the internet, 

1. Package the app as a directory that contains the `app.R` file (or `server.R` and `ui.R` files) as well as all supporting files used by the app.
1. Launch the app in the RStudio preview window
2. Click "Publish"

![](shinyapps-publish.png)

3. Alternatively, run

```{r eval = FALSE}
shinyapps::deployApp("<filepath to app directory>")
```

`shinyapps` will upload the app to <http://shinyapps.io>, where it will be hosted with its own URL.

### password protect

To password protect your app, 

1. Visit your app dashboard at <http://shinyapps.io>
2. Navigate to the "Users" tab
3. Set Application visibility to "Private"
4. Enter authorized users

### archive

To archive an app (the app will no longer be accessible over the internet

1. Visit your app dashboard at <http://shinyapps.io>
2. Click the "Archive" tab
![](shinyapps-archive.png)

3. Alternatively, run

```{r eval = FALSE}
shinyapps:terminateApp("<filepath to app directory>")
```
